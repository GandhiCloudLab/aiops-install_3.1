## Show it

### Offline Click Through Demo

If you need an easy and fast way to demo AIOps in an "almost real" way you can use the Click Through Demo built with PowerPoint.


The file is [AIOps INTERACTIVE DEMO 3.1 2021](./AIOps_INTERACTIVE_DEMO_2021_3.1_V9.ppsx) in this repository.

I have added a short [Demo Walkthrough](https://ibm.box.com/s/8kxbb50dt4vkari2gsiw0hrin9gi6ivp) video.

**NEW:** As well as special version of the PowerPoint with highlighted click targets in order to make it easier for you to train for a fluid presentation [AIOps INTERACTIVE DEMO 3.1 2021 - TRAINING PPT](./AIOps_INTERACTIVE_DEMO_2021_3.1_V8_TRAINING.ppsx) 

## Install it
